# Pixel Viewer

Image viewer created for pixel art specifically, available on Windows and Linux.

The default photo app on Windows was giving me some problems with not being able to stay zoomed in while switching images, so I tried making my own version to give a better user experience.

Features:
  - image info in title bar for maximum viewing surface
  - scale to fit window, or any percentage of the window by pressing 1-0
  - wasd or right mouse click drag to drag image
  - arrow keys left/right or left mouse click to switch images
  - arrow keys up/down or scroll wheel to zoom
  - keys z, x, c to rotate either direction or flip image
  - launch aseprite with `e`, set PIXEL_EDITOR variable to change command
