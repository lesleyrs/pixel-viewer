# Pixel Viewer

Image viewer created for pixel art specifically, available on Windows and Linux.

The default photo app on Windows does not let you switch between images if the image is zoomed in too far, which is always the case with small pixel art. This tool fixes that problem, although it's not as polished.

Features:
  - image info in title bar for maximum viewing surface
  - scale to fit window, or any percentage of the window by pressing 1-0
  - wasd or right mouse click drag to drag image
  - arrow keys left/right or left mouse click to switch images
  - arrow keys up/down or scroll wheel to zoom
  - keys z, x, c to rotate either direction or flip image
  - launch aseprite with `e`, set PIXEL_EDITOR variable to change command
